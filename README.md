 Basketball Scoreboard!

Just a little project I worked on! 😀

You will be able to press the buttons and keep track of your score!
Press +1 +2 +3 and you'll see the scoreboard increment!

Through this project, I was wondering if there can be a better way to build my JavaScript much more simple.
And I guess this question is my next thing to figure out! ✌🏻
